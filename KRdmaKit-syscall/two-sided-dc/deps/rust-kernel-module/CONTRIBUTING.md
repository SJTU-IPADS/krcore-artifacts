# Contributing

We're always excited to have contributions of any form!

Examples of contributions include:

* Code patches
* Documentation improvements
* Bug reports and patch reviews

## Filing issues

If you're filing an issue for a build error, please include enough information
for us to diagnose and reproduce the issue. This generally means, at a minimum
the kernel version (and, if it's not a vanilla upstream kernel, where you got
the kernel from) and your compiler versions (Rust, Clang, and GCC).

## Contributing code

To contribute code, you can send a pull request on Github. Please make sure your
code is formatted with `cargo fmt`, builds, the tests pass, and it's `cargo
clippy`-clean. Don't worry, we've got continuous integration if you miss
anything.
