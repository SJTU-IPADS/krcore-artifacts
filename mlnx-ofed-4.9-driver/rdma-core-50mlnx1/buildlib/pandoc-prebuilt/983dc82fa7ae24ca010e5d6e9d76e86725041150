\f[C]
#include\ <infiniband/verbs.h>

int\ ibv_req_notify_cq(struct\ ibv_cq\ *cq,\ int\ solicited_only);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]ibv_req_notify_cq()\f[] requests a completion notification on the
completion queue (CQ) \f[I]cq\f[].
.PP
Upon the addition of a new CQ entry (CQE) to \f[I]cq\f[], a completion
event will be added to the completion channel associated with the CQ.
If the argument \f[I]solicited_only\f[] is zero, a completion event is
generated for any new CQE.
If \f[I]solicited_only\f[] is non\-zero, an event is only generated for
a new CQE with that is considered "solicited." A CQE is solicited if it
is a receive completion for a message with the Solicited Event header
bit set, or if the status is not successful.
All other successful receive completions, or any successful send
completion is unsolicited.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
\f[B]ibv_req_notify_cq()\f[] returns 0 on success, or the value of errno
on failure (which indicates the failure reason).
.SH NOTES
.PP
The request for notification is "one shot." Only one completion event
will be generated for each call to \f[B]ibv_req_notify_cq()\f[].
