# Rust user RDMA base 

Provide an RDMA bindings in the user space (similar to `rust-kernel-rdma-base` crate in this repository). 

## Credits 
Several binding scripts (e.g., `build.rs`) are from https://github.com/datenlord/rdma-sys. 
Yet, since they don't support Mellanox drivers, we provide a simplified version. 
In the future, we may port it back to `rdma-sys`.
